## My process

First I started with getting the whole markup done in HTML and after that I moved onto making it look good with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Right at the start I learned how to work with list items in both ordered and unordered lists. It took me quite a bit of time to figure out how to put more empty space between the marker and the text.
Then I had problems with displaying a border after each row, after I finally managed to solve that I couldn't figure out how not to display the border after the last row.


### Continued development

I need to work on my CSS skills even more, doing this challenge made me realize how bad I am with styling list items and table contents, at the end of the day I managed to get it to work the way I wanted it to work but it took me a bit longer than I originally planned.
